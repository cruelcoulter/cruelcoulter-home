            <h1>Civil War Letters</h1>
            <p> These pages contain five letters a relative of mine wrote during and immediately   after the Civil War.
              The author of the letters is   <a href="https://cruelcoulter.com/family/family_detail.php?family_member_id=13" target="_BLANK">Francis Pettibone</a> of the   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/105th_Ohio_Infantry" target="_BLANK">105th   Regiment Ohio Volunteer Infantry</a>. He entered the service Aug. 5, 1862, at age   18 for a three-year tour of duty. The recipient of four of the letters is his   uncle, C.A. Pettibone of Girard, Pennsylvania (near Erie). </p>          </div><!-- /.jumbotron -->
